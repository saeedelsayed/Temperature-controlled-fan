## How it work
#### If the temperature is less than 30C the fan is off
#### If the temperature is greater than or equal 30C the fan is on with 25% of its maximum speed.
#### If the temperature is greater than or equal 60C the fan is on with 50% of its maximum speed.
#### If the temperature is greater than or equal 90C the fan is on with 75% of its maximum speed.
#### If the temperature is greater than or equal 120C the fan is on with 100% of its maximum speed.
